Section B04, Colin Jenmot


1. What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?
The most interesting topic we covered was the potential applications of search. We saw how search technology is used in many obvious and not-obvious fields and how it is a cornerstone of modern society.

2. Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.
I would want to investigate the interactions between two different types of search. For example, I would love to compare semantic and graph embedding searches, analyze their strengths and weaknesses, and even possibly combine them for a better search.

3. What is a potential change youâ€™d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?
I would make it more structured. I feel like it started out very small until we were rapidly slammed with work, so maybe I would implement a better, more balanced, schedule.

4. What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?
I would wanna try other searches, other methods of increasing relevance, and many other metrics of evaluation. I feel like all three of these things are the pillars of any search algo so it might be fun to mix it up for the next quarter.
